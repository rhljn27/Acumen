Alumni Connect Using Massively Embedded Networks

This App provides a private platform for the alumni of any particular college to connect. Since Colleges most of the private colleges in and around West Bengal do not have any Alumni Network, there is no interaction between the Alumni and present students. Alumni are unable give back to their colleges since they do not know the needs of the students. Also, students are unable to get a proper look into the present industry situation and hence do not know anything about the industry trends or the type of skill they need to develop for better future.

A platform which connects the students and to their helpful Alumni will help in creating better grooming methods, improving the teaching learning process and hence creating professionals with edgy skill set.

The app started out as a final year project and is still in the development phase.
